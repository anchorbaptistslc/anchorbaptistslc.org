# Outreach

**On the other side of every door,**

## There is someone who needs a Saviour

As Christians it is our duty to go forth and share the gospel of Jesus Christ. At Anchor Baptist Church we believe in that the Great Commission that Jesus gave His church encompasses every individual, across the street and around the world. 

> And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
> 
> Mark 16:15

Sharing the gospel not only provides others an opportunity to come to Christ, but it is an opportunity to fellowship with your fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. Together, we share the excitement and the blessings of going door to door and reaching out to a needy world.
