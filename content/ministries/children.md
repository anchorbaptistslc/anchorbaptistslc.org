At Anchor Baptist Church, we offer a comprehensive children's ministry program from nursery through 6th grade, providing age-appropriate Bible teaching, activities, and fellowship for every child.

**Nursery**

Child care is provided during the Sunday school hour as well as every Worship Service.

The nursery is available for children ages 0 thru 3 years old.

**Jr. Church**

Every Sunday morning at 11 AM, our 4 year olds thru 6th grade will learn a Bible story, have a snack, and participate in a craft that they can take home! They learn Bible truths, sing fun songs, play amazing games, and earn prizes!

**3 Years Old â€“ K5**

Teacher: Mrs. Angela Bolt

SIMPLE BIBLE STORIES, COLORFUL CRAFTS, and SMILING FACES make learning fun and easy for this amazing class. If you have children in this age group, then we're positive that they will feel LOVED and EXCITED every Sunday!

**1st thru 3rd Graders**

Teacher: Mrs. Carrie Haire

As your children grow, we desire for their knowledge of BIBLE TRUTHS to grow along with them. This class accomplishes this desire by lessons that are both ENGAGING and PURPOSEFUL!

**4th thru 6th Graders**

Teachers: Bro. Seth and Mrs. Claudia Amman

In this class, our young boys and girls are taught how to serve both the Lord and others through lessons that challenge their SOUL, SPIRIT, and MIND.
