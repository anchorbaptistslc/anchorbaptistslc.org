# Teens

**NEXT LEVEL Youth â€“ 7th thru 12th Grade**

What a privilege it is to impact the next generation for Christ! At Anchor Baptist Church we have an exciting class for teenagers that meet once a week on Sunday Mornings at 10:00 am during our Sunday school hour. Each meeting will encourage teens to follow God's will for their life as they grow and mature. Activities, camp, and youth conferences will be milestones as our teens make decisions to walk with God!

Service opportunities are available through music, children's work, and outreach. 

Teachers: Bro. Jordan and Mrs. Samanthan Lendt
