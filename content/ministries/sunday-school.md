# Sunday School

Sunday School is a vital part of our church ministry. We believe that the Bible is God's Word and that it is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness. Our Sunday School ministry is designed to help people of all ages learn and grow in their knowledge of God's Word.

We have classes for all ages, from nursery through adults. Each class is taught by a qualified teacher who has a heart for teaching God's Word and helping others grow in their faith. Our teachers use the Bible as their primary textbook and seek to make practical application of biblical truth to everyday life.

Our Sunday School meets every Sunday morning at 10:00 AM. We invite you to join us as we study God's Word together!
