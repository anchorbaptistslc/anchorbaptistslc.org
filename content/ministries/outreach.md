---

As Christians it is our duty to go forth and share the gospel of Jesus Christ. At Anchor Baptist Church we believe in that the Great Commission that Jesus gave His church encompasses every individual, across the street and around the world. 

## Our Mission

**On the other side of every door, there is someone who needs a Saviour**

> And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
> 
> Mark 16:15

## Get Involved

Sharing the gospel not only provides others an opportunity to come to Christ, but it is an opportunity to fellowship with your fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. Together, we share the excitement and the blessings of going door to door and reaching out to a needy world.

## Activities

Our outreach ministry includes:
- Door-to-door evangelism
- Gospel tract distribution
- Community events
- Special outreach programs
