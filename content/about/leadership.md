Pastor Jason Atwood was born and raised in South Texas near Corpus Christi. He was raised in a Christian home and was saved at an early age. During his first year at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi, he was called to preach at a missions conference in his home church in Beeville, Texas. The next fall he enrolled in Bible college where he met his future wife Aime√© who grew up in a pastor's home in Milwaukee, WI and was saved as a child. Both Pastor and Mrs. Atwood graduated from Fairhaven Baptist College in Chesterton, Indiana with bachelor's degrees. They are blessed to have three boys who love the Lord.

In 2006, God led the Atwoods to plant Heritage Baptist Church in Corpus Christi, Texas. God's blessings were evident on the ministry there through many souls saved, discipled, and some called to the ministry. The church started in a one-bedroom house and eventually bought an existing church building where an auditorium was constructed by the church members shortly after the purchase. Two years later, God led Heritage Baptist Church to move to another 5 acre site that would allow for future growth and expansion. After 13 years at Heritage, Pastor Atwood and his family moved to the North Valley Baptist Church in Santa Clara, CA where they had the privilege to serve in the ministries. It was there that Pastor and Mrs. Atwood taught at Golden State Baptist College and Pastor Atwood was an assistant to Dr. Jack Trieber.

On August 23, 2020, Pastor Atwood was installed as the senior pastor of Anchor Baptist Church. We invite you to visit us at our next service and catch the vision for what God can do in the Salt Lake Valley!
