## Our History

Anchor Baptist Church was organized on December 25, 1960, with James G. Baynes as its founding pastor. Under his leadership, the work of building a new church was begun at 5600 South (Anchor's present location). Pastor Baynes never saw the completion of the church building for the Lord called him home in January of 1963.

In March of 1963, Thomas H. Miller accepted the call to come and pastor at Anchor. Under his leadership, a new educational building was added, and a Christian school was started in 1973.

Pastor Thomas E. Corkish was invited to candidate at Anchor and was called to be the pastor in March of 1976. On December 27, 1987, the church built a new auditorium and is the present meeting place of Anchor Baptist Church.

After many years of faithful service, Dr. Corkish stepped down as senior pastor, and Randall Love became the new senior pastor on June 3, 2012 until August 2020.

On August 23, 2020 Pastor Jason Atwood was called to be the pastor of Anchor Baptist Church.
