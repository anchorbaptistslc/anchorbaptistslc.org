# Plan Your Visit

### Visiting

At Anchor you will find a warm atmosphere that is both inviting and enjoyable. We consider our visitors to be honored guests, and once you arrive, ushers will be readily available to help you and your family get settled in for the services. Our main auditorium is located just behind the two buildings closest to the road. As our guest, you will find Visitor Parking that is close to the main entrances.

### Nursery

Here at Anchor, we love families! Starting with excellent nurseries, there is something special for every child. During every service there are safe, clean, and highly staffed nurseries for children three years old and under. Children four years old through sixth grade experience fun, friendly, and Bible-centered classes during the main worship time. These classes are staffed with trained, friendly, and well-qualified teachers and helpers who will make church exciting and memorable for your child. Our greeters and ushers are located in the lobby of the Sanctuary as well as the parking lot entrance and will gladly help direct and even escort you to the right classrooms.

### Assistance

Our church is fully equipped to meet the needs of handicapped individuals, and we provide interpretation for the hearing impaired.

### Will I be required to give an offering?

No. We don't invite you to our church for you to give to us. Instead, our hope is that the service will be our gift to you. We hope you will find in this place a warm family spirit, truth from God's Word, and a place where you can grow in God's grace. Please don't feel any obligation to participate in the offering as a guest.

### What should I wear?

There is not a dress code at Anchor Baptist Church. Although we never apologize for encouraging people to "dress their best" for church, and our ministry leaders and many of our church family dress in more traditional "Sunday" dress, you will find people from all walks of life and backgrounds who feel very much at home here at our church.

### Are your services live-streamed?
