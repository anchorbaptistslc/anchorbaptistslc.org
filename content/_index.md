Anchor Baptist Church is a local, independent, Baptist church centrally located on the east side of the Salt Lake Valley.

We are a church that is focused on following the teachings of our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, by reaching our world with the Gospel message. Anchor desires to be found loving, honoring, and faithfully serving our Lord when He comes again!

At Anchor you will find a church where your family will be loved! Each service you will find Bible teaching and preaching as well as songs and hymns that will stir the heart.

Guests are always welcome to worship the Lord with us in our services. We invite you to find your place at Anchor and serve the Lord with us!
